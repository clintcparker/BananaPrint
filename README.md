 #BananaPrint

## Inspiration
We were inspired by the recent build keynotes, and their focus on accessibility, and also leveraging the cloud to improve accessibility. We also think 3D printing is super cool.

## What it does
Converts verbal commands to physical output. 

## How we built it
We used a combination of Microsoft Speech Recognition APIs, the Microsoft LUIS API, and the 3D printing dialog from Windows 10. And we rolled it all into an easy to use Windows UWP App.

## Challenges we ran into
The docs for the Speech APIs were tough to navigate without assistance from our friends at Microsoft. We also added an unnecessary step to our print process, which introduced a troublesome bug. And last but not least, we spent a few hours troubleshooting some issues targeting the correct windows platform on our dev machines.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Meeting our goals and self-imposed deadlines. Staying friends. Actually sleeping.

## What we learned
We already knew it, but the concepts were reinforced: Microsoft has so much technology it hurts sometimes. They also have, without a doubt, the best swag.

## What's next for BananaPrint
* Thingiverse integration
* Better images & design
* Tests (it was a hackathon after all)
* Your ideas coming to life
